### CPSC 120

- Lab 12
    Lab 12, part 1 was my favorite lab in this course. I found it interesting
    because I did not realize you could make an animation in C++.
    I learned one way to make a simple animation in C++.

- Lab 3
    Lab 3, part 1 was my second favorite lab in this course. I appreciated it
    because this was one of the first labs where we started using
    std::cout and std::cin, and it had a large mathematical portion.
    I got to practice using std::cin and std::cout, while also learning
    effficient ways to compute mathematical equations in my code.

- Lab 7
    Lab 7, part 2 was my third favorite lab in this course. It reminded me of
    my high school computer science course, where we made a blackjack game in
    java. It was interesting to learn how to make a blackjack game in C++ and
    how it compared to the java one that I made previously.
